## About this project

This project manages the downloading, transcription 
and playing of podcasts, the latter being done by a PWA which shows 
the transcription in sync with the mp3.

This repo is checked out twice, once on a Mac Mini, where the downloads and 
transcriptions are performed using a version of whisper optimised for apple silicon,
and once on a synology, where the PWA is served from a docker container.
