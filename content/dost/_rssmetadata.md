No guest is too taboo. \nNo conversation is too unsafe for this show. Watch or listen to Dostcast every Tuesday and Friday at 8 PM Indian Standard Time. \n\nAbout the host: Vinamre Kasanaa is a writer and content creator. He studied advertising and religion at Boston University and returned home to setup the best conversation network for Indians.
